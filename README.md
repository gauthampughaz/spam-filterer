# Spam Filterer

In this notebook, I have created a simple Feed-forward Neural Network model using Keras to classify spam emails based on this [dataset](https://spamassassin.apache.org/old/publiccorpus/). I have used NLP techniques inspired from this [notebook](https://github.com/ageron/handson-ml2/blob/master/03_classification.ipynb) and tweaked it to process and transform the data. Furthermore, I used Scikit-learn pipelines to perform data cleaning, data transformation, and modelling seamlessly on the training and testing datasets.

Cross-validation score on training data: **98.35%**

Final accuracy score on unseen test data: **99.20%**
